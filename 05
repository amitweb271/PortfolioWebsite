Project Handover to Sanket

Dear [Manager's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. As I will be on leave from November 23, 2024, to December 5, 2024, to attend my brother's wedding, I am handing over my project responsibilities to Sanket during this period.

I have discussed the handover with Sanket, and he is fully briefed about the project requirements, timelines, and current status. I have also shared all necessary documents and details to ensure a smooth transition.

Should any issues arise, Sanket can reach out to me via email or phone, and I will assist as much as possible remotely.

Please let me know if there is anything else I need to address before my leave.

Thank you for your understanding.
