**Subject:** Leave Application for Brother's Wedding

Dear [Manager's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to formally request leave from November 23, 2024, to December 5, 2024, as I need to attend my brother's wedding in my village.

This is an important family event, and my presence is necessary. I will ensure that all my responsibilities are taken care of before my leave, and I will be available to assist with any urgent matters via email or phone.

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to your approval.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]  
[Your Position]  
[Your Contact Information]
